# LoDimP/Experiments

This directory contains executable scripts for training multiple probes
at once and aggregating the results. Although most scripts are written
in Python, you should think of them as effectively bash scripts. They do
not depend on the `lodimp` library and interact with it only through
its command-line interface.
