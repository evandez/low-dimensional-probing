"""This module contains all task-specific code.

We work with four linguistically motivated tasks: part of speech tagging (POS),
dependency edge prediction (DEP), dependency label prediction (DLP), and
semantic role labeling (SRL).

Task-specific code is meant to be minimal. Most core logic can be found in
common/ modules.
